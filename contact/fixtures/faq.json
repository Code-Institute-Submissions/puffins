    "title": "How does Pre-Order work?",
    "answer": "Our Pre-Order items help to reduce one of the biggest sustainability problems in the fashion industry. Every year thousand of unsold and overproduced items go to waste - hence we want to takle this challenge and are trying to produce only as much as there is needed/wanted.\r\n\r\nBy doing this we can better calculate our product price and can offer you a discount. Due to this method of ordering and producing you might experience a wait up to 12 weeks, but you can be sure that when you get your item, it will amaze you!",
