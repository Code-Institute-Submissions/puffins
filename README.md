_"Always be yourself. Unless you can be a puffin, then always be a puffin."_

We at [__puffins__](https://thepuffins.herokuapp.com) are dedicated to provide beautiful, uniting and sustainable products to individuals, love birds and families. With our mehtod to only produce whats demanded by our customers and delivering longlasting, high quality products we want to counter the biggest problems of the western society. Our products are locally produced in Europe and we only use materials where we know the origin, to guarantee 100% ethical and sustainable products.

This site is the final Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Course at Code Institute. The core requirements focus on bulding a fullstack site with the use of Django, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a relational database. The final result is hosted on Heroku, while storing static and media files on an S3 Cloudstorage from AWS. The store is connected to [Stripe](www.stripe.com).

To test the site incl. the checkout process please use the test credit card number provided in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing):

# UX

## Purpose and Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create an ecommerce shop for sustainable clothing especially targeted towards young couples and families. The goal is to create this shop as an interactive fullstack website that allows customers to browse products, make purchases by credit card and if registered manage a wishlist or see their orderhistory. These goals should be supported by providing a clean and easy to use website that allows seamless navigation and has a low bounce rate.

## Design process
Before laying out the project and creating an initial design market research was done. During this research phase the following questions were also acknowledged: 
* How do other stores look?
* What are typical design patterns used across stores?
* Which site are appealing to me?
* Which kind of stores fit to my business idea? 

The final layout was influenced by the following sites:
* [twothirds.com](https://twothirds.com/)
* [taylorstich.com](https://www.taylorstitch.com/)
* [manitober.de](https://www.manitober.de/)

## Target group

* women and men aged between 25 and 40 years 
* who care about the environment,
* especially coupls who may have 1 or 2 children in the age of 6 month to 12 years
* mid-high income
* with a passion for living outdoors and owning sustainable high quality products

## Layout, Styling & Wireframes

The wireframes were created in Figma. Figma is a cloud based desing tool which allows you to rapidly create prototypes, wireframes and layouts [Figma](www.figma.com)

The whole figma project can be accessed here:
[Puffins - Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/MhxXXrKoRhGyWMhX1cug2U/puffins?node-id=0%3A1)

#### Logo

The puffins logo was created by [polardots](https://www.polardots.studio/). It shows a vector style puffin stand upright and is signaling joy to the world!

The puffins text logo was created by me with [Figma](www.figma.com).

![Puffins Textlogo](https://thepuffins.s3.amazonaws.com/media/puffins_logo_dark.svg)

#### Color Scheme

The color scheme was chosen with the goal to represent a lightweight modern website. The colors are taken from the base colors of the puffin bird.

## Database structure

During development the built-in SQLite3 database from django is used. However, for the deployment to Heroku a switch to postgressql was undertaken.
[Djangoâ€™s authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/auth/) in combination with [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) is used to manage users and permissions.
The structure of the products and checkout app are based on the [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/ckz8780/boutique_ado_v1) project from Code Institute.
